Mouselib
========================

A small C library that I wrote for x86 (32 and 64 bit) systems. It has basic math functions and data types.

## How do I compile Mouselib?
To compile Mouselib make sure you have gcc, and run the makefile (by typing `make` in the terminal) in the "src" folder.

## Is it under a license?
Yup! Look at LICENSE

## Can I test it?
Absolutely! Check under the "tests" folder! It even has instructions!
